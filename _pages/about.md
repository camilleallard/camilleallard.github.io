Hi! I am Camille Allard, currently a research fellow at the department of Social and Political Science, University of Milan.

I am a `Sociologist`, researching different aspects of `caring` and the `care economy` from a `feminist` perspective. In particular, I am interested in understanding how care is structured and distributed in `organisations` such as workplaces, schools, and social movements.

My PhD research, part of the ESRC (Economic and Social Research Council of the UK) funded [Sustainable Care Research Program](https://sustainable-care.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/research/care-work-and-relationships/combining-work-and-care), has focused on the management and implementation of `care policies in workplaces`. I have also conducted research as part of the Wellcome Trust funded [WISE project](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/applied-health/research/healtheconomics/wise-study) on how workplaces and schools support the wellbeing of their students and workforce.

Currently, as part of the PRIN funded [YECEI project](https://yecei.com/persone/camille-allard/) I am researching how `grassroot political organisations` and activists conceive the future of climate change, with a particular interest on the relevance and role of care in these `imaginaries`.

My research has been featured in _Who Cares: The hidden crisis of caregiving, and how we solve it_ by Emily Kernway (2023 Orwell Prize Finalist), in the _Care Matters Podcast series_ and has informed a consultation led by the UK Government (Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy) on the implementation of the `Carer's Leave Act 2024`.
