Hi! I am Camille Allard, currently a research fellow at the department of Social and Political Science, University of Milan.

I am a `Sociologist` researching how `care` is distributed and organised in `organisations`, from a `feminist` perspective. My research, part of the ESRC (Economic and Social Research Council of the UK) funded [Sustainable Care Research Program](https://sustainable-care.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/research/care-work-and-relationships/combining-work-and-care), has focused on the management and implementation of `care policies in workplaces`. I have also conducted research as part of the Wellcome Trust funded [WISE project](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/applied-health/research/healtheconomics/wise-study) on how workplaces and schools support the wellbeing of their students and workforce.

Currently, as part of the PRIN funded (Progetti di Ricerca d'Interesse Nazionale funded by the Italian government) [YECEI project](#) I am researching how grassroot political organisations and activists conceive the future of climate change, with a particular interest on the relevance and role of care in these imaginaries.

My research has been featured in _Who Cares: The hidden crisis of caregiving, and how we solve it_ by Emily Kernway (2023 Orwell Prize Finalist), in the _Care Matters Podcast series_ and has informed a consultation led by the UK Government (Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy) on the implementation of the `Carer's Leave Act 2024`.
