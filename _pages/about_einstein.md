Hi! I am Camille Allard, currently a research fellow at the University of Milan, department of Social and Political Science.

I am a Sociologist researching how care is distributed and organised in organisations, from a feminist perspective. My research, part of the ESRC (Economic and Social Research Council of the UK) funded [Sustainable Care Research Program](https://sustainable-care.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/research/care-work-and-relationships/combining-work-and-care), has focused on the management and implementation of care policies in workplaces. I have also conducted research as part of the Wellcome Trust funded [WISE project](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/applied-health/research/healtheconomics/wise-study) on how workplaces and schools support the wellbeing of their students and workforce.

Currently, as part of the PRIN funded (Progetti di Ricerca d'Interesse Nazionale funded by the Italian government) YECEI project I am researching how grassroot political organisations and activists conceive the future of climate change, with a particular interest on the relevance and role of care in these imaginaries.

My research has been featured in _Who Cares: The hidden crisis of caregiving, and how we solve it_ by Emily Kernway (2023 Orwell Prize Finalist), in the _Care Matters Podcast series_ and has informed a consultation led by the UK Government (Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy) on the implementation of the Carer's Leave Act 2024.
