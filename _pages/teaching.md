`2024-2025`

I have led '`The Politics of Care`' laboratory (20 h) the  academic year at the `University of Milan`, Department of Social and Political Science. The laboratory, open to Undergraduates and Postgraduates, has focused on providing students with the tools to critically analyse the organisation of care in modern society, drawing from a wide range of theoretical and practical sources.

I have also been Teaching Assistant for the `Globalization and Social Justice course`.

`2022-2024`

I have been co-lecturer of the '`Policy + Economics of Healthcare Delivery`' module at the Department of Health Economics, at the `University of Birmingham`. The module, dedicated to MSc Postgraduate Students, examined the role of health economics across a range of issues including resource allocation, equity and fairness, decision rules, policy and practice relating to healthcare delivery.

I have also acted as Teaching Assistant for the courses `Introduction to research` and `Sociology of Professions: ‘becoming’ a doctor`.

`2019-2021`

I have also been `guest lecturer` and `seminar leader` for multiple courses and modules at the Department of Sociological Studies and the Management School, `University of Sheffield`.
